# Reikniv√©l(e. Calculator)

This is a Maven project that provides a simple calculator. 
The calculator is able to perform addidtion, subtraction,
multiplication and division of integers. 

# Project Structure

The project follows the standard Maven project structure, which is as follows:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the folders vinnsla and vidmot. 
    - `is/vidmot/ReiknivelController.java`: Controller class for the calculator. Contains the handlers for the integers and the operators. Connects to classes in the vinnsla folder. 
    - `is/vidmot/ReiknivelApplication.java`: Reads the description of the user interface from the .fxml file and make the calculator appear.
    - `is/vinnsla/Reiknivel.java`: Contains the methods for addidtion, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers.
    - `is/vinnsla/Reikna.java`: Functional interface for the calculation methods. Reads to integers and returns an integer.

- `src/main/resources`: 
    - `reiknivel-view.fxml`: Provides information about the appearance of the calculator.

- `src/test/java`:Contains all the test cases for Reiknivel in a file called ReiknivelTest.

# Maven Commands

The following Maven commands are available for this project:

- `mvn compile`: Compiles all implementation classes.
- `mvn exec:java`: Executes the main method of the implementation.
- `mvn test`: Runs all test cases (i.e. all classes with a name that either starts with `Test` or ends with `Test`
  , `Tests`, or `TestCase`).
- `mvn site`:  Generates a website that documents various aspects of the project, such as project reports, dependencies, and code quality metrics.
- `mvn package`: Creates a distributable package of the project's compiled code, along with any necessary dependencies and resources, such as JAR or WAR files.

# Running the Project

To run the project execute the following command:

`mvn exec:java`

# Testing the Project

To run the JUnit4 test cases for stack implementation, execute the following command:

`mvn test`

# Patterns
This project uses two patterens. 
- `The Observer pattern` which is a design pattern that allows one or more objects to be notified of state changes in another object. It enables objects to maintain consistency and avoid duplication of code by automatically notifying all interested parties when a change occurs.
- `The strategy pattern` is a behavioral design pattern that allows different algorithms to be selected and used at runtime based on specific requirements. It enables objects to vary their behavior dynamically and independently of their clients.
- Both patterns are used in the [Reiknivel class](./src/main/java/is/vinnsla/Reiknivel).
