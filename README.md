# Reikniv√©l(e. Calculator)

This is a Maven project that provides a simple calculator. 
The calculator is able to perform addidtion, subtraction,
multiplication and division of integers. 

# Project Structure

The project follows the standard Maven project structure, which is as follows:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the folders vinnsla and vidmot. 
    - `is/vidmot/ReiknivelController.java`: Controller class for the calculator. Contains the handlers for the integers and the operators. Connects to classes in the vinnsla folder. 
    - `is/vidmot/ReiknivelApplication.java`: Reads the description of the user interface from the .fxml file and make the calculator appear.
    - `is/vinnsla/Reiknivel.java`: Contains the methods for addidtion, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers.
    - `is/vinnsla/Reikna.java`: Functional interface for the calculation methods. Reads to integers and returns an integer.

- `src/main/resources`: 
    - `reiknivel-view.fxml`: Provides information about the appearance of the calculator.

- `src/test/java`:
